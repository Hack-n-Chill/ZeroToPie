# LocEssent

A centralised place to find essential services like restaurants  , hospitals and shopping malls in an area .

## Inspiration
The need to locate essential sevices near us which has become more important amidst the Covid crisis . 

## Implementation
1. First time users need to sign up while the existing users can log in the app.
2. The user gets a choice to search via both online search and offline search .
3. For the offline search , we have created our own data which includes some  of the major places in our city . The data includes the information of all the essential services with specifications to further narrow down the results.
4. For the online search , the current location of the user is found by using google APIs . Then using nearby place feature of google API it finds the neraby restaurants , hospitals and malls. 

Though we could not combine all the features in a single app but we are ~~positive~~ (Oops a wrong word to use in 2020) satisfied with the end result and look forward to complete the project .

## Future vision 
1. To add filters( i.e. for resataurants having the option to choose a specific cuisine and similarly for other searches as well )  in the online search .
2. To store the data in a more efficient way for the offline search so that the user can save the offline search result for any city of his/her choice .
